# Morning Reminder for Self-Care

This project is a morning reminder designed to help people with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) not forget about their needs and start the day with positivity. Every day, the program generates personalized wishes based on the current date, time of day, and the user's name using the Groq neural network API. Music - cover of "Undertale - Waterfall," (piano) and a drawing created by my friend Dräug.
